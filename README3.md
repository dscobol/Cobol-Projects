NOTE: Change in plan.

Most of the CBLXXXX programs are fairly straight forward.

I think my time would be better spent on more "advanced" topics like Tables, VSAM and DB2.

I did convert CBL0001 to my "style" and by creating ODS000C, learned a few things.
  * Converting COMP numbers to normal to be usable by gnuCobol.
  * Using MOVE CORRESPONDING - Not something I normally do but it worked well for this.
